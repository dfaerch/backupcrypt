SETUP

You need to create a "key-file". This is a simple textfile with your
encryption password/passphrase on the first line of the file (and the file
must contain nothing else).

Example:

echo "S00perS3cr3tP@zzw0rt" > ~/.backupcrypt.key


USAGE EXAMPLES

# Example of encrypting and decrypting in one go (just a simple test to see
# that everything works) 
cat /etc/passwd | ./backupcrypt -f ~/.backupcrypt.key | ./backupcrypt -d
